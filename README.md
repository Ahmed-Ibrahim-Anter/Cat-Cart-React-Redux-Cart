# Cat Cart ?

The aim is to use React and Redux  to build a web app that lets a user buy Cats from  the “Cat Cart” Web.

 The user can browse the cats and choose from them to add to the purchase cart, remove them from the purchase cart, or complete the purchase process

## Installation

- install all project dependencies with yarn install.
- start the development server with yarn start.
- ccess the app on <http://localhost:3000/>

## Technologies used

- React
- Redux toolKit
- React Router
- React-Bootstrap

## Important

As the app works with a pseudo backend server, there is no data persistence and hence, any new questions or answers will be lost by performing a browser refresh.

### `Backend Server`

Currently _DATA.js file is used to mock backend.
